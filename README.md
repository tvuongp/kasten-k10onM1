Kubernetes is gaining prominence for production workloads but how do you explore operational concerns like backup and restore. 

Enter. Kasten K10 (https://www.kasten.io)
* Backup / Recovery
* Disaster Recovery
* Application Mobility


I have created a lab environment on my laptop to support K10. This environment leverages Rancher Desktop https://rancherdesktop.io for the Kubernetes installation.

Rancher Desktop:
Container Management and Kubernetes on the Desktop
An open-source desktop application for Mac, Windows and Linux. Rancher Desktop runs Kubernetes and container management on your desktop. You can choose the version of Kubernetes you want to run. You can build, push, pull, and run container images using either containerd or Moby (dockerd). The container images you build can be run by Kubernetes immediately without the need for a registry.


The goal was to create desktop/ laptop self-contained Kubernetes environment and deploy Kasten to explore its features and use cases. Familiarity and mastery of its interface as well. 


Equipment: 
* Macbook Pro 14"  M1 Max
* 64 Gb RAM
* 2 TB Storage

You might be able to do it with less resources YMMV
